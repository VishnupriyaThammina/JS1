execution context => {
    memory => variable environment;
    code => thread of execution;
}
2 phases=>{
    phase 1 => skims and declares variabell with memeory 
            as undefined for vars and stores code in function variables

    phase 2 => code is ran and assings variables
}

how is it ran???
{
    using call stack[execution context stack, program stack, control stack, runtime stack, machine stack];

}

Hoisting can access the elements not assinged but declared can be accessed 
due to execution context two phases runing and the call stack
 


 function creation in javascript 
 gec has values
 and lec has different values
 once it is executed it is exhausted after the return statement


 js is loosly typed
 we can put anything and everything
